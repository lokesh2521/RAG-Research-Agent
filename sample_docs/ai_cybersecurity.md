# AI in Cybersecurity

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied in cybersecurity to detect threats, automate responses, and predict vulnerabilities. Machine learning models can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns that indicate attacks or unusual behavior.

## AI Applications
1. **Threat Detection:** AI systems can detect malware, phishing, and intrusions faster than traditional rule-based systems.
2. **Fraud Prevention:** AI analyzes transactional data to detect anomalies in financial systems and prevent fraud.
3. **Vulnerability Management:** AI models can predict which systems or software components are likely to be exploited, enabling proactive mitigation.
4. **Behavioral Analysis:** AI tracks user behavior to detect insider threats or abnormal access patterns.
5. **Automated Response:** AI-driven systems can automatically quarantine infected files or block suspicious IP addresses.

## Risks and Challenges
- AI models can be fooled by adversarial attacks designed to bypass detection.  
- Privacy concerns arise when monitoring large amounts of user data.  
- Over-reliance on AI may reduce human oversight in critical security decisions.

## Best Practices
- Combine AI with human analysts for more accurate threat assessment.  
- Regularly update models with new threat data.  
- Test AI systems against adversarial attacks to ensure robustness.

## Case Studies
- **Darktrace:** Uses AI to detect insider threats and unusual network activity.  
- **Cylance:** AI-based endpoint protecstreamlit run app_streamlit.py

tion that predicts malware before execution.

## Conclusion
AI enhances cybersecurity by providing advanced threat detection, predictive capabilities, and automated responses. However, human oversight and continuous model improvement are essential for effective defense.
