## Step 1: Provide a short overview and definition.
- Quantum computers use qubits that can exist in superposition, enabling certain algorithms to break RSA and reduce symmetric key strength. [src:quantum_intro.md:page1]

## Step 2: Effects/impacts
- Harvest-now-decrypt-later is a near-term risk. [src:cyber_case_study.md:page1]
